= Master/Slave Checkboxes

The Master/Slave checkbox controls are used to provide a user-friendly (and developer friendly) way of acheiving bulk selection from a list of records.

* Select All / Deselect All
* Select a checkbox by clicking on a parent element
* Style a parent element of the checkbox based on checkbox state

We can demonstrate these features with some simple examples of selecting some ingredients for a burger.
