# Specifying Themes for Individual XPages

The ExtLibX library provides a modified FacesContext which enables you to specify a specific theme for a specific XPage.

## Usage Instructions

Obviously a first step is to ensure you have installed the ExtLibX Library

Then add the `xsp.theme` property for each XPage that you would like to configure a specific theme for:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<xp:view xmlns:xp="http://www.ibm.com/xsp/core">

	<xp:this.properties>
		<xp:parameter name="xsp.theme" value="oneuiv2"></xp:parameter>
	</xp:this.properties>
		
</xp:view>
```

## How does it work?

The ExtLibX library registers a new FacesContextFactory, which means that it will be responsible for creating the FacesContext object.

It creates a modified FacesContext object which is an extension of the normal FacesContext. This modified FacesContext will check the XPage to see if any theme has been specified for it specifically.

### Disabling the Modified FacesContext

If you find a reason that you need to disable the use of the modified FacesContext, you can do so by setting the following application property (in `xsp.properties`) 

```
xsp.extlibx.facescontextfactory.enabled=false
```
