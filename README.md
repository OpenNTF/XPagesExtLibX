Bootstrap 4 Alpha
=================
Bootstrap 4 is the next major release of the open-source Bootstrap project. The first release was over 4 years ago, and each major release has brought with it significant changes. Currently, Bootstrap 4 is in alpha state, with a yet to be announced full release date. We are adding the alpha version of Bootstrap 4 to the ExtLibX project now in order to start preparing for Bootstrap 4â€™s future release. By laying the foundation for Boostrap 4 in XPages in the ExtLibX project during the alpha phase, it will facilitate its addition to the core Extension Library in a prompt manner once Bootstrap 4 is actually released. Futhermore, it gives the XPages community the opportunity to contribute to the development of Bootstrap 4 support in XPages between now and its official release.

Maven Configuration
===================

In order for your maven build to be successful, you need to specify the location of the 'Domino Update Site'. The best way to do this is to specify the **notes-platform** property in your maven profile. somehow ??
